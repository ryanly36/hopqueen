The game we plan on making is in the style of a 2D Platformer. The character will start at the bottom of the “map” and will have to jump on platforms to reach the top. Rather than horizontal, like traditional 2d platformers our game will be strictly vertical. The concept is a one shot climb to the top, where if you fall, you essentially lose all your progress. Because of this, there will be no checkpoints where you can save and retry a jump. The progress you gain while climbing and failing will teach you how to not mess up the jump you failed previously. There will be no “health” for the character as the character will not take damage for falls. There is, however, a penalty for falling as your progress will have been reset.

The whole game is based around our main character, the Hop Queen, who tries to follow her lover, the “Hop King” to the top of the tower. On the way to the top, our Hop Queen will have to face the same challenges and overcome the same obstacles that her Hop King had once done.

We plan on completing this game, with at least three minutes of play time on a perfect run, but 20-30 hours on average. There will be other mechanics like an air dash and obstacles like icy floors and spikes. We will consider at least six floors as a completed map.

The game will have a steep learning curve but will be rewarding to those who become familiar with the jumping mechanics to get through the difficult sections of the game.

Assets that we will be using will be imported from free sites Unity Engine opengameart.org Itch.io github.io

Characters: Our game will feature only one playable character, Hop Queen, on her journey to the top to reach the NPC Hop King with only one real interaction.

Game World: Our game will feature a dynamic map that changes whenever a new floor is entered. Each new floor will have its own background and layout. For example, the starting area will be somewhat of a basement, One floor will be dungeon themed, with a dark background and castle-like platforms. Another could be an icy cavern where the background is blue and snowy. One can also be a lava biome, where it is an island that is covered in molten lava. Another floor can be like a jungle with branches as platforms. The final floor will be the rooftop of a castle.

Comparisons to other games: Our games main inspiration will be from the game Jump King where the main concepts are being used like a vertical 2D Platformer and stage transitions. Other inspirations would be games like Getting Over it With Bennett Foddy for the simplistic mechanics but challenging platforming and Celeste with the games movement mechanics including an air dash to get to platforms a normal jump isn’t able to.
